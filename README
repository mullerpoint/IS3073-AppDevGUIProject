AppDevMain.py - this is the Main file, this file contains all the code necessary to run the project.

AppDevGUI.py, help.py, version.py - these files are all class files that define the GUI for the windows and Dialog boxes

appDevGui.ui, help.ui, version,ui - these files are the generic output files from Qt5 designer


To run the example you just need the Python files not the UI files
run with 'python .\AppDevMain.py'


to convert the *.ui files into python files you must have Qt5 designer installed
- locate the install path
- open a terminal at that path
- run .\pyuic5.bat -o <location of output> <location of input>
    - <location of output> is the location you want your .py file saved
    - <location of input> is the location you have saved your .ui file
